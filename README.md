# Smart_Agriculture
The mini project on smart agriculture aims to develop a system that utilizes IoT and AI technologies to optimize the growth and yield of crops. The system consists of various sensors and devices that monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture. The data collected by these sensors is analysed using ML.
